## Overarching questions

-   How do conspiracy narratives correspond to socio-political conditions?

-   What is the *paranoid style* of politics?

\-\--

### Section 1: The paranoid style 

-   In which sense are conspiracy theories "paranoid"?

. . .

> \"the clinical paranoid sees the hostile and conspiratorial world in which he feels himself to be living as directed [specifically against him]{.underline}; whereas the spokesman of the paranoid style finds it [directed against a nation, a culture, a way of life]{.underline} whose fate affects not himself alone but millions of others.\" (Hofstadter, 1996, p. 4)

------------------------------------------------------------------------

-   Is political paranoia a *pathology*?

-   How does it relate to truth?

. . .

> \"[Of course, the term "paranoid style" is pejorative]{.underline}, and it is meant to be; the paranoid style has a greater [affinity for bad causes]{.underline} than good. But nothing entirely prevents a sound pro­gram or a sound issue from being advocated in the paranoid style \[...\]. Style has to do with [the way in which ideas are believed and advocated]{.underline} rather than with the truth or falsity of their content.\" (Hofstadter, 1996, p. 5)

. . .

> A [distorted style]{.underline} is, then, a possible signal that may alert us to a [distorted judgement]{.underline}. (6)
