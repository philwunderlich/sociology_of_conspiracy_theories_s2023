-   In which ways are "motives" relevant to what people think?

:::

# Epistemic motives

## Psychological processes {.incremental}


- illusory pattern perception

. . . 

> „Social psychological research has shown that people are averse to the randomness of socio-political events and impose meaning on it cognitively by perceiving patterns in events, and making causal explanations, even when they do not exist (Zhao et al. 2014)“ (Douglas et al., 2020, p. 182)

. . .

- spurious correlations

---

::: incremental
- proportionality bias

- need for cognitive closure
:::

### Alternative information

# Existential motives

## Lack of control

- How can conspiracy theories make you feel safe?

> „(...) people who lack instrumental control may be able to find some compensatory sense of control by adopting conspiracy theories, because conspiracy theories offer people the opportunity to reject official narratives and feel that they possess some power by having an alternative perspective“ (Douglas et al., 2020, p. 183)

## Attachment styles

::: incremental
- Attachment theory (early-childhood experiences)
  - Attachment alleviates anxiety and increases security.
  - Anxious attachment style.
:::

. . . 

> „Green and Douglas (2018) found that anxious attachment style – which is characterised by a preoccupation with security and a tendency to exaggerate threats – significantly predicted conspiracy belief when the other two attachment styles did not. People may therefore adopt conspiracy theories in an attempt to cope with negative attachment experiences that stem from childhood and continue into adulthood.“ (Douglas et al., 2020, p. 183)
