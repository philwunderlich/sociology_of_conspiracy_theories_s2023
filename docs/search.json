Compared to the past, I think conspiracy theories have become disseminated at a faster pace. Also how these theories are becoming more and more popular by the media can be a difference between two. \n(…) popular conspiracy theories today struggle to identify who the persecuted party is. (…) The conspiracies described by Hofstadter had historical context and some reality-based argumentation even if it was exaggerated or misrepresnted. QANON and the Covid/Antivax conspiracies, many of them are based on online-fantasy then adjusted to fit whatever narative needs to be presented in the moment, which also makes them extremely difficult to keep track of, verify, or disprove. \nFor instance, in the vaccination conspiracies, the concern was not a certain way of life, it was rather human health which made it so universal and believable by massive groups.\nI don’t think that the modern conspiracy theories are that different. The fear of strangers, loosing your privileges (…) is something that is common in a lot of conspiracy theories."
